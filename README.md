# Explaining Student Clustering Based on Test Results Using Natural Language Generation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing and implementing a method for clustering students based on their test performance and providing meaningful explanations for the resulting clusters. The main components of this project include:
1. **Initial Experiments**: Conducted through various Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files), these experiments laid the groundwork for our clustering approach, allowing for preliminary analyses and hypothesis testing.
2. **EduClus Library**: A library that integrates clustering algorithms with Natural Language Generation, designed to automatically group students based on their educational performance and provide coherent explanations for these groupings.
3. **Data**: `csv` files containing datasets used for clustering, ensuring that the data is clean and ready for analysis.

### EduClus Library

- **Description**: EduClus is a custom library developed to integrate the clustering of student performance data with NLG-based explanations.
- **Use Cases**:
    - **Clustering Student Data**: Automatically groups students based on their performance in different test sections.
    - **Generating Explanations**: Provides textual explanations for each cluster, summarizing the characteristics and knowledge areas of students within the cluster.
    - **Educational Insights**: Helps educators identify strengths and weaknesses across different student groups, facilitating personalized interventions and data-driven decision-making.
